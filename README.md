# Spread of Coronavirus around the World - Geospatial Analysis

This project was developed by Eduardo Passos, and this time-series map series aims to visually represent the global spread of coronavirus; without numbers, as we are all aware of the case numbers. The objective here is to be minimalist. To create this, I used the open-source software QGIS, downloaded the dataset from Johns Hopkins University on Github, spatialized the .csv file to represent the cases on the map, and built a timelapse by the date of reported cases.
